Raspberry Pi Python Projects
First time using a Raspberry Pi 400(keyboard) and learning to code with Python
In the official Raspi beginner's guide (chapter 5) there's an RPG game that you mostly download from rpf.io/rpg-code (rpg-rpg.py)'
Once you start adding lines you get to the monster that should attack; however, it only treats it as an item and can be picked up ('get')
I've poured over these lines and everything seems to be exactly the same as in the guide, but it still doesn't work
PLEASE HELP!
